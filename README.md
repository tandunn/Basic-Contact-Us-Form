# Basic-Contact-Us-Form

This is a basic form that saves a copy of field inputs to a file called "response.txt".

If the file already exists, it is overwritten.

This is done using node.js, npm, and express.js, which must be installed for the backend to work.

Once these are installed and the repository is cloned, you can run "npm install" in the root folder to install any further dependencies, followed by "node server.js" to host the app.

You can then connect to the app at http://localhost:8080/ (unless you change the port used in the code, which you are free to do).
